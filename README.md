# Sarcasm Detection Using BiLSTM on Imbalanced Data 🤖💬

Welcome to the **Sarcasm Detection Using BiLSTM on Imbalanced Data** project! This project aims to tackle the challenge of detecting sarcasm in text using a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) model, particularly when dealing with imbalanced datasets.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Sarcasm in text can be challenging to detect due to its subtlety and the imbalance in data classes. This project leverages BiLSTM networks to identify sarcastic comments and improve detection accuracy on imbalanced datasets.

## 🔍 Features

- **Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM):** Utilizes BiLSTM for capturing context from both past and future sequences in text.
- **Imbalance Handling:** Implements techniques to address class imbalance in the dataset.
- **Sarcasm Detection:** Focuses on identifying sarcastic remarks with high accuracy.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Python** 🐍
- **TensorFlow/Keras** for BiLSTM implementation
- **Scikit-Learn** for additional machine learning utilities
- **Pandas** and **NumPy** for data manipulation

## 📈 Results

- **Accuracy:** Achieved 97.40% on the test set.
- **F1 Score:** 97.47% indicating model performance on imbalanced data.
